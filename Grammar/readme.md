The file grammar.txt is a formalisation of the grammar used in this program, HOWEVER it is still a work in progress and is inaccurate. 

The grammar will soon be modified/updated to be a CFG, and a lot clearer in intent/purpose. 

Proposed updates include: 
    -Mandatory '=' instead of SET being implied
    -Count comes after function names (currently it preceedes)
    -Function names become limited to Alphabet characters and _ - 
    -Consideration on if the token '/' is valid for function names (such as open door/object)
    -Commands must be wrapped in quotation marks (such as "DISCO")

A formal grammar will also likely be made for the configuration file.
